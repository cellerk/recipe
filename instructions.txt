INCREDIBLY MOIST AND EASY CARROT CAKE
2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons baking soda

1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt

1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon

1 ¼ cups (295 ml) canola or other vegetable oil

1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar

1 cup (190 grams) lightly packed brown sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

4 large eggs, at room temperature

3 cups (300 grams) grated peeled carrots, 5 to 6 medium carrots

1 cup (100 grams) coarsely chopped pecans

1/2 cup (65 grams) raisins


Directions
MAKE THE BATTER
1 Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottom with parchment paper and then grease the top. Or grease and flour the bottom and sides of both pans.

2 Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176C).

3 Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until very well blended.

4 In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla.

5 Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each one.

6 Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add the dry ingredients in three parts, gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth.

7 Stir in the carrots, nuts, and raisins.

BAKE CAKE
1 Divide the cake batter between the prepared cake pans.

2 Bake until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.
